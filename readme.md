# emergencyAssist
ITMD-455
This is a project to create a messenger type android application that will be used on college campuses.
The idea is to create an app that will provide an emergency message and GPS data to stored contacts,
for emergencies that may happen around campus.

The application has simple user interface that provides one button that will need to be long-pressed by user in an emergency. Once it is pressed, the app will send a message to all the family and friends in the contacts stating they are in an emergency along with GPS coordinates. The user is able to customize their message if they like or use the default message as well.
